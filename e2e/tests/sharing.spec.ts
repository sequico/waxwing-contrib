/**
 * Sharing a mail folder (S-3) and being told about one (S-1), end to end against a live Stalwart
 * that really enforces the grants.
 *
 * Runs in the shared-account suite (`playwright.shared.config.ts`), which is the only configuration
 * where delegation is turned on — see `shared.setup.mjs` on why that is opt-in.
 *
 * **Both features are about state that OUTLIVES the browser**, which is why neither can be asserted
 * anywhere but here:
 *
 *  - a grant is a `Mailbox/set … shareWith` on the server, and the proof that it landed is that
 *    reopening the dialog — a fresh `Mailbox/get properties:['shareWith']`, not a React state — still
 *    lists the person;
 *  - a `ShareNotification` is created by the SERVER when someone else shares something, and only a
 *    second real account can create one.
 *
 * Everything these tests grant, they revoke; `shared.teardown.mjs` sweeps whatever an aborted run
 * leaves behind (`revokeAllShares`), because a share left on alice's account reshapes bob's and
 * carol's sidebars in every later suite.

 *
 * A hover is a POSITION, and the rail moves: the share-notice strip sits above the tree, so a card

 * of 5: `<div role="treeitem" … class="_item_…"> intercepts pointer events`, after `element is not

 * Focus is a REFERENCE. It survives the row moving, so `:focus-within` holds and the control stays
 * hittable. `press('Enter')` then activates it without a coordinate at all. A real reader meets the
 * same hazard — a click that opens the folder instead of its menu because the list shifted — but
