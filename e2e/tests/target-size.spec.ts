/**
 * M4.7 — target size (WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum), Level AA), against the live fixture.
 *
 * This cannot be a unit test, and that is the whole reason it exists: jsdom computes no layout, so
 * `getBoundingClientRect()` there returns zeroes for everything. The size of a control is decided by
 * padding, line-height, flex sizing and the icon inside it — four things only a real engine resolves.
 * Every check in the repo that could see a too-small button is structurally blind to it.
 *
 * **The threshold is 24 × 24 CSS px, not 44.** SC 2.5.8 (AA, the project's stated conformance target)
 * asks for 24; the 44 px figure is SC 2.5.5 Target Size (Enhanced), which is Level AAA. The
 * implementation plan said 44 — corrected there, because quietly measuring against a AAA number and
 * reporting AA conformance is the wrong direction, and quietly measuring against AA while the plan
 * says 44 is the other wrong direction. 44 is measured too and REPORTED, never asserted.
 *
 * The exceptions in SC 2.5.8 are honoured explicitly rather than by omission:
 *
 * - **Inline** — a target in a sentence, sized by the text flow (a link inside message body text).
 * - **User-agent** — a control the page does not style (none here; native `<select>` etc. would be).
 * - **Essential** — where a specific presentation is legally required or the only way to convey the
 *   information. Nothing in Waxwing claims this.
 * - **Spacing** — a target smaller than 24 px still passes if a 24 px circle centred on it overlaps
 *   no other target's circle. This is IMPLEMENTED (see `spacingPasses`), because it is the exception
 *   real toolbars actually rely on, and skipping it would mean either false failures or a weaker rule.
