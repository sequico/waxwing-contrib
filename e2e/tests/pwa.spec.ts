/**
 * M3.10 PWA suite — the first tests in this repo whose subject is the SERVICE WORKER (FR-OFF-01,
 * NFR-SEC-02; handed over from M3.5).
 *
 * WHY ITS OWN FILE. Every other suite runs with a worker quietly active and never looks at it. These
 * tests depend on it, and specifically on a piece of choreography that is easy to get wrong and
 * silent when you do — so it is spelled out once, here, rather than re-derived per test:
 *
 *   **A freshly registered worker does not control the page that registered it.** `sw.ts` calls
 *   neither `skipWaiting()` nor `clientsClaim()`, deliberately (its header explains: claiming a live
 *   tab drops the old precache and the tab's next lazy chunk 404s). So the first load of a fresh
 *   BrowserContext is served entirely by the network, the worker's `fetch` handler never runs, and
 *   an offline assertion made at that point would prove nothing about the precache. Control arrives
 *   only on the NEXT navigation. Hence every test below reloads once, and gates on
 *   `navigator.serviceWorker.controller !== null` — NOT on `navigator.serviceWorker.ready`, which
 *   resolves on an ACTIVE worker and says nothing about this page being controlled. That is the same
 *   distinction `register-sw.ts` encodes as `isStale()`, and getting it wrong yields a test that
 *   passes vacuously.
 *
 * Runs under playwright.read.config.ts: it needs the seeded corpus and the same-origin proxy, and
 * that config is already serial with a per-test reseed. It needs the PRODUCTION bundle too — the
 * worker is registered behind `import.meta.env.PROD` (use-update-prompt.ts) — which `vite preview`
 * satisfies and `pnpm dev` deliberately does not.

    //
    // M3.5's hand-over asked for "an offline reopen with an authenticated session, showing cached
    // MAIL behind the offline marker". Until 2026-09-04 the app could not do the second half, and
    // this test was a TRIPWIRE that pinned the gap with `toBeHidden()` on the mail: the precached
    // shell booted, `restore()` succeeded, and then `SessionProvider.boot()` fed the restored
    // session into `connectSession()` — which fetches the JMAP Session document from the network.
    // Offline that threw, and the reader got the sign-in form reading "Could not reach the server"
    // with a fully populated replica sitting behind it, unreachable.
    //
    // R-78 / ADR-041 closed it, and the tripwire did its job: the fix made this file go red, and
    // this is the rewrite it demanded. The Session document is now kept beside the credentials in
    // the encrypted `waxwing-auth` store — NOT in the service-worker cache, whose invariant is
    // still zero bytes from JMAP (the test below this one is what proves that), and not in the
    // replica, which outlives a plain sign-out. A cold start with no network rebuilds its client
    // from it.
    //
    // The four assertions below are the four halves of FR-OFF-01's sentence, in order: the shell
