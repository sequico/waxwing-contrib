 * One reconciliation pass: bring the Web Push subscription in line with what the user asked for
 * (M4.0, FR-NOTIF-02). Extracted from the React host so it can be tested — the host is then a
 * `useEffect` that calls this and nothing else.
 *
 * It is worth separating precisely because the failure it guards against is **silence**. If this
 * pass stops running, or takes a wrong branch, nothing breaks visibly: the app works, the settings
 * still say notifications are on, and the user finds out a week later when the seven-day grant
 * lapses and the banners simply stop. There is no error to surface, no state to inspect, and no
 * moment at which anyone would connect it to a change made today. So each branch gets a name and a
 * test rather than living inside an effect nobody can drive.

/**
 * Run one pass. Never throws: a subscription that cannot be established is a feature that does not

 *
 * **Tearing down and being unable to act are DIFFERENT, and conflating them destroyed working
 * subscriptions in a loop.** The first version collapsed the master switch, the permission, the
 * server capability and the client into one `wanted` boolean and tore the subscription down whenever
 * it was false. But three of those four are *transient*: `client` is null while the session
 * reconnects, `serverSupports` is false until the session document has loaded, and `permission` is
 * `default` before it is read. So an ordinary reconnect — or the re-render that follows a push —
 * destroyed a healthy subscription, the next pass built a new one, and the verification code the
 * service worker had just parked now belonged to a subscription that no longer existed. The
 * handshake could never complete, and each round did it again. Observed live in Chrome's
 * `gcm-internals` (2026-07-23, B29): message received at 22:17:15, unregistration in the same
 * second, re-registration 44 s later.
 *
 * So the rule is: **only an explicit "no" tears anything down.** The master switch being off is the
 * user's own answer; a `denied` permission is the browser's. Everything else — no client, no
 * session, capability not yet known — means *we do not know yet*, and the honest response to not
 * knowing is to leave the subscription alone.
