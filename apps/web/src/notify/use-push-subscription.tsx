/**
 * Keeps the Web Push subscription in step with what the user asked for (M4.0, FR-NOTIF-02).
 *
 * Mounted inside the connected shell, beside the sync engine. It runs on every start, which is not
 * an optimisation but the mechanism: Stalwart grants a subscription **seven days at a time and
 * refuses to grant more** (measured — a 90-day request returns seven), and only a running client can
 * renew. A user who opens the app once a week stays covered; one who does not, does not, and the
 * settings copy says so rather than letting it lapse in silence (ADR-017).
 *
 * The state it reconciles has three inputs, and two of them can change without us being told:
 *  - the master switch (`localPrefs`), which the settings screen writes,
 *  - the browser's Notification permission, which the user can revoke in site settings at any time,
 *  - whether the server advertises RFC 9749 at all, which follows the session.
 * Any of them going false must TEAR THE SUBSCRIPTION DOWN, not merely stop creating one: a server
 * still pushing to an endpoint after the user switched notifications off is the same broken promise
 * as one that never pushes, only louder.
