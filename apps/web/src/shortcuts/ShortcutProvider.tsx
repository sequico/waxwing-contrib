/**
 * The ONE global keydown listener (M3.8, FR-UI-04) — plus the two lazy overlays it opens.
 *
 * It listens on `window` in the BUBBLE phase, deliberately. React 19 attaches its handlers at the app
 * root (a descendant of `<body>`), so every existing component handler — the grid's arrows, Squire's
 * ⌘B/I/U/K, the composer's ⌘↵/Escape, the menu type-ahead — runs FIRST, and each of their
 * `preventDefault()` calls becomes a free, precise veto here (step 1). A capture-phase listener would
 * pre-empt all of them, which is exactly the "shortcut conflicts with the editor" bug this design
 * exists to prevent.
 *
 * Escape is NOT bound here: `ui/internal/useDismiss` owns it through a LIFO stack, so the innermost
 * overlay always wins. Two owners for one key is the bug, not the feature.
