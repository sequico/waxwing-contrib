/**
 * What a delegated account is ALLOWED to become in the app (S-4).
 *
 * The measurement this file defends, taken against the live Stalwart v0.16.18 fixture on
 * 2026-08-21: a share of one single object makes the whole owning account appear in the recipient's
 * session with **all seventeen** capabilities. Sharing a calendar advertises mail. Sharing an
 * address book advertises mail and files. The capability list cannot tell the areas apart, and
 * `secondaryMailAccounts()` — the strictest test the session offers — reads exactly that list.
 *
 * Two things were built on it and both were wrong: a mail section over a folder tree that could
 * never fill, and, invisibly, a whole SYNC ENGINE started for an account whose every `Mailbox/get`
 * answers `forbidden`. The engine is the reason this test sits here rather than beside the sidebar:
 * it reads `connected.accounts` and renders nothing, so no assertion about the rail could ever have
 * caught it.
