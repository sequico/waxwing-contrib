/**
 * Pure, DOM-free routing primitives (M1.4, ADR-007).
 *
 * Waxwing ships its own tiny hash-free router instead of a dependency: the route set is
 * closed and small, and the load-bearing requirement — resolving links under an arbitrary
 * mount prefix (Stalwart's `<base href>`, FR-DEP-02) — is a one-liner over `document.baseURI`
 * here but an awkward fight against a library's basename plumbing. These helpers know nothing
 * about React or the DOM, so they unit-test directly.
 *
 * Two coordinate spaces:
 *  - the REAL `location.pathname`, e.g. `/mail/inbox/42` (or `/deploy/mail/inbox/42` when the
 *    app is mounted under `/deploy/`);
 *  - the BASE-RELATIVE route path the app reasons about, e.g. `/mail/inbox/42`.
 * `deriveBase` extracts the prefix from `document.baseURI`; `toPath`/`toHref` convert between
 * the two spaces; `matchRoute` classifies a base-relative path into a {@link RouteMatch}.
