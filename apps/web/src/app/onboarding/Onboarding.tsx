 * from being fixed — putting "reset this app" under it invites someone who mistyped their password
 * to throw away their offline mail. The two OAuth-callback keys are the same argument on the other
 * sign-in path: an IdP that answered `access_denied` did what the reader told it to, and an
 * exchange that failed because the sign-in page sat open too long is fixed by starting over. In
 * none of the four is the LOCAL state what is wrong, which is the only thing a reset addresses.
 *
 * Every other error, including the generic one, is a candidate for "the local state is what is
 * wrong", which is exactly the case with no other way out (U2).
