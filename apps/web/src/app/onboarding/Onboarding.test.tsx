/**
 * The onboarding container's one piece of logic: WHEN the app offers to delete itself (U2).
 *
 * A start-up can fail in a way that no retry fixes — stale local state was the observed case, with
 * no failed request anywhere — and the sign-in screen then offers nothing but the button that has
 * just failed. The escape hatch exists for exactly that, which is also why it must not appear
 * under a mistyped password: there it would invite someone to throw away their offline mail to fix
 * a typo.
