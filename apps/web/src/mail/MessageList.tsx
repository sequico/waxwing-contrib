 * focus and moves an `aria-activedescendant` across virtualized rows (so focus is never lost when a
 * row scrolls out and unmounts), with container-delegated keyboard (arrows/space/enter/shift-range/

 * choices persist locally, a selection-driven bulk-actions bar (read/flag/archive/junk/trash/delete → the engine

   * checked header box over a folder of 300, next to an `aria-rowcount` of 300 and a bar reading
   * "50 selected". Nothing was ever mis-TARGETED (the store prunes and never invents ids, and the

   * EXISTS with `ids: []` and a non-zero `total` reads as loaded-and-empty. It is neither — the
   * window says it has mail and holds none of it. This is NOT a closed set — an earlier revision of
   * this comment enumerated "three paths" and a checker found a fourth by reading `delta.ts`. What
   * follows are the paths KNOWN to produce the shape, and the recovery argument is stated so that an
   * unknown fifth does not silently inherit a promise written for these.
   *
   * KNOWN producers, all of which VOID the window (`queryState: null`):
   *   1. a bulk move's OPTIMISTIC prune, which retracts a whole loaded head page (a folder of 200
   *      with a 50-id window leaves `ids: []`, `total: 150`);
   *   2. the ROLLBACK of one from a server REJECTION (`outbox.ts`'s `retractWindows`, whose tail
   *      eviction the undo cannot record);
   *   3. the same rollback reached from a DISCARDED dead letter.
   * Painting the confident empty state in any of these contradicts the `aria-rowcount` rendered
   * beside it and makes the live region announce "no results" for a folder that has some, so this
   * state suppresses them all — and suppresses the shape itself, however it arose, which is why an
   * unenumerated producer still gets the right rendering even where the wording below over-promises.
   *
   * What it does NOT do is claim progress, and the honest statement of WHY is a NETWORK call:
   * `delta.ts`'s `Email/query` (`fullRequery`). Two things reach it, and only the first is a
   * detector: a VOIDED window is re-queried on the next pass, and — independently of voiding —
   * `engine.ts` forces a full pass every `FULL_SWEEP_EVERY` (5) sync passes, with a safety sweep
   * every 60 s under it. There is NO detector for empty-ids-with-non-zero-total anywhere in the
   * engine: a producer that leaves `queryState` NON-null is not recovered by the voiding mechanism
   * at all, only by that periodic sweep, and only online. `delta.ts`'s `applyQueryChanges` is
   * exactly such a producer on paper (it drops `added` entries whose index lands past the shortened
   * `ids`, so a removal of the whole head page can write `ids: []` with a carried-over `total` and a
   * live `queryState`). UNPROVEN against a real server and filed as §13 **B17** — go there rather
   * than re-deriving the argument here.
   *
   * On the three known paths, connectivity is what separates them, and none of them is guaranteed
   * prompt. A rejection IS a server answer, so path 2 proves we were online at ROLLBACK time — not
   * at RECOVERY time: the connection can drop in between, and on the replay path (`reconcileWatched`
   * with `onlyVoided`, which is the one a rollback's re-query takes) `engine.ts` re-voids and DEFERS
   * rather than writing the answer whenever `pendingOutbox` is non-empty, so during a triage burst
   * the re-query is not immediate either. Paths 1 and 3 have no guarantee at
   * all. The optimistic prune runs offline by design; and the rollback has an offline arm —
   * `discardFailed` (`engine.ts`) runs an OWED undo with NO connectivity check, reached from
   * `use-outbox-problems.ts`, `replayOutbox`'s `online === false` bail does not cover it, and
   * `applyUndo`'s `mailboxIds` arm is a purely LOCAL transaction, so offline it does not fail, it
   * SUCCEEDS and retracts the window right there. Discard a dead letter offline and the state
   * persists until the connection returns: nothing is retrying, `loadMore` is gated on
   * `ids.length > 0` and will not rescue it either. Nothing here can tell the paths apart, so this
   * message is written for the reconnect-bound ones — the same limitation already recorded for B2's
   * arrival direction. Hence its own message
   * (`list.stale`) rather than the spinner's "Loading messages": it names the CONDITION (out of
   * date, refreshing on the next sync) instead of claiming progress that, offline, is not happening.
   * `outbox.ts`'s `retractWindows` / `invalidateWindows` docs carry the other half of this and hedge
   * the same way ("USUALLY that is immediate"); the two halves reference each other on purpose, so
   * correct both or neither.
   *
   * Only this INCOHERENT combination is caught. `total === 0` and an unknown `total` (a persisted
   * `null`, which `use-message-list.ts` surfaces as `undefined`) are the genuine empty cases and
   * still say so out loud — a swallowed empty state would be the worse bug.

   * The two toggle predicates, hydrated from the SELECTION's own rows.
   *
   * Deliberately NOT from the list's `rowById`, which the read button used to read: that map holds
   * the VIRTUAL WINDOW only, while select-all dispatches over the whole window. Select all, scroll,
   * and every off-screen selected row resolves to `undefined` there — the predicate reads false even
   * when every message qualifies, so the button SETS what the `s` chord would CLEAR.
   *
   * Parity is with `s` ONLY, and it is worth being exact about that. `s` (`registry.ts`,
   * `triage.flag`) is a toggle and therefore hydrates the same predicate from the full target set —
   * `targetsAllFlagged` in `use-shortcut-context.ts`, which is this guard shape line for line, so
   * the two can drift and the shared shape is what stops them. `u` (`triage.unread`) is NOT a
   * partner: it is an unconditional `setSeen(targetIds, false)` with no predicate behind it, so it
   * hydrates nothing and cannot drift from anything. It is named here only because the read button
   * is the surface a user would expect it to agree with.
   *
   * The shape itself: a result that has not caught up with `ids` is not trusted, and an unhydrated
   * row never counts as qualifying (the safe way round — the button then offers to set, and setting
   * a keyword a message already carries is harmless).
   *
   * TRADE-OFF, named here rather than left to be rediscovered as "B9 did not fully fix the drift":
   * this is the THIRD live subscription over this selection. The list's own is
   * `useEmailWindow(visibleIds)` — the VIRTUAL WINDOW, a different id-set from this one — and
   * `use-shortcut-context.ts` already runs `useEmailWindow(targetIds)` over exactly the set this bar
   * holds, and already derives the finished predicate as `targetsAllFlagged`. Three independent
   * subscriptions resolve on their own ticks. This one is not deduped against the shortcut
   * context's: `useShortcutContext` is consumed only by `ShortcutProvider`, so sharing its result
   * means hoisting it (store or context) — plumbing that belongs to plan row B10, which is where the
   * next reader should go rather than rediscovering this.
   *
   * The cost meanwhile is bounded (the selection, and this bar only mounts when there is one), it
   * converges, and every side reads the same table, so the worst transient is a label one tick
   * behind — which the `selectedRows.length === ids.length` guard above turns into the SAFE label
   * ("set") rather than a wrong one. It is never a dispatch against stale data: the click reads

   *
   * `if (move(…)) onClear()`: `useTriage`'s boolean is false in exactly three cases — `to` unknown,
   * `to === from`, empty `ids` — and all three are already excluded before the button exists.
   * `canMoveTo`'s two remaining terms cover the first two; the third is impossible because this bar

   * before a move button is drawn" pins the gate instead, so weakening one of them goes red
   * and makes these two lines load-bearing again.
   *
   * Why keep them, then. One divergence is genuinely outside the gate's reach and is the reason this
   * is not simplified away: `canMoveTo` reads BulkBar's own `useMailboxByRole`, while `useTriage`
   * holds a SEPARATE `useLiveQuery` subscription to the same query. Nothing makes two subscriptions
   * render in step. Probed directly (two subscriptions in one component, the role mailbox inserted
   * under a mounted tree) they landed in the same render every time under React's batching — so the
   * skew is not demonstrated, and no claim is made that this line catches it. It is cheap insurance
   * against a divergence the type system cannot see and the gate does not own, and it keeps each
   * call site correct on its own rather than by reference to a condition three lines up.

     * and the `#` chord's shortcut context carries the same distinction — `ShortcutContext.inTrash`
     * in `shortcuts/types.ts` is documented, verbatim: True when the acted-on messages live in
     * Trash (there, "delete" means destroy). Those two are this bar's peers: all
     * three act on a hand-picked target from wherever the user happens to be standing, and all
     * three resolve `inTrash` against the TRASH role alone. The bulk bar was the one of the three
     * that offered a permanent destroy from ANY folder.
     * Do NOT cite `FolderTree`'s `olderMode` for this rule — an earlier version of this comment
     * did, and it says the OPPOSITE: `role === 'trash' || role === 'junk'` → `'destroy'`. That is
     * a different family of action, not a contradiction to resolve. "Empty Junk" / "Delete older
     * than…" are FOLDER-LEVEL PURGES: named for the folder, confirmed in their own dialog, and
     * permanent in both purge folders by spec — FR-ORG-04 pairs "empty-trash / empty-junk" as one
     * feature, `FolderTreeView` puts one Empty entry on BOTH purge roles and picks its label by
     * role ("Empty Trash" / "Empty Junk"), and `Engine.deleteOlderThan` is documented "for
     * Trash/Junk cleanup". Nothing in that family
     * speaks for what an icon-only button does to five ticked rows.
     * So Junk parts company with Trash HERE and only here, and the reason is the kind of action,
     * not the folder: a hand-picked delete in Junk stays recoverable, because Junk is where a
     * false-positive classification lands and this button has no dialog naming the folder. Both
     * halves are pinned — `MessageList.test.tsx` "offers the recoverable move in Junk, not the
     * permanent destroy" and `FolderTree.test.tsx` "destroys permanently from Junk even though a
     * Trash exists to move to" — so moving either surface to the other's rule fails a test that
     * states the rule out loud.
     * What that costs, stated rather than glossed: from Junk, or from a source-less cross-folder
     * search selection, the bulk bar no longer permanently destroys. Junk keeps "Move to Trash"
     * and its own "Empty Junk"; a search selection keeps read/flag/label and gets neither
     * destructive button, which is the same gate `canMove` already applies to every move here.

   * The second step, and the way back out of it, as ONE row of its own under the actions.

   * Its own row because of what the row above it is: `.bulkBar` is `flex-wrap: nowrap` with an
   * overflow menu sized by measuring the space the actions have left, and a text button wedged
   * between the count and that measurement makes every width the app ships for tighter — worst on a
   * phone, where "50 of 300 selected" and "Select all 300" are most of a 390px line before a single
   * action has been drawn. A row of its own has the width for both states at every tier, and it is
   * also the shape the pattern is known by elsewhere (Gmail's strip above the list).
   *
   * The two states are one control in one place, which is the point: the step in and the step back
   * are the same size, in the same spot, and the way back reuses the sentence the header checkbox
   * has always used for it (`list.clearSelection`) rather than inventing a second name for it. The
   * checkbox still clears too — this does not replace it, it makes it visible to someone who is not
   * looking for a checkbox.
