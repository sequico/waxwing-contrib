/**
 * Contacts area (M4.2): the responsive three-/two-/single-pane frame, built on the SAME layout
 * machinery as {@link ../app/shell/MailScreen} ({@link SplitPane} + {@link computePaneLayout} +
 * {@link useLayoutTier}) so contacts and mail feel like one app:
 *
 *  - desktop (>=64em): a persistent address-book rail + a resizable list|detail {@link SplitPane};
 *  - tablet (>=40em): a rail DRAWER + the list|detail split;
 *  - phone (<40em): a single pane, list XOR detail, where opening a card is a route change so the
 *    browser/OS Back gesture returns to the list.
 *
 * Selection is entirely the ROUTE (`/contacts/:bookId/:cardId`): the address book, the open card and
 * which pane the phone shows all derive from it, so there is no local selection state to fall out of
 * sync. Contacts always splits list beside detail on wide screens (Apple Contacts has no reading-pane
 * preference), so the mode is fixed to `right`.
