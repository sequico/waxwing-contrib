/**
 * Contact CRUD actions (M4.2, stage 5b) — the seam from the contact form/detail UI to the stage-5a

 * handler always sees the current one (and is a safe no-op before the engine has started or where it
 * cannot run — jsdom, older browsers). This hook only DISPATCHES; the optimistic apply, undo and
 * conflict handling all live in the engine. Rights are enforced by the UI before an action is offered.
