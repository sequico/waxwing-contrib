/**
 * The address-book rail (M4.2) — the contacts analogue of the folder tree. Lists every address book
 * for the account ({@link useAddressBooks}), preceded by an "All Contacts" entry, and marks the one
 * the route selects with `aria-current`. Entries are real {@link Link}s (base-path-safe,
 * open-in-new-tab friendly), exactly like the primary nav and the folder tree.
 *
 * **Management (JMAP gap analysis, B-5).** Creating a book had been implemented, tested and exported
 * since M4.2 stage 5a with no caller anywhere in the UI, and renaming/removing did not exist at all —
 * so this list was read-only in practice and its own header comment said "create/edit land in a later
 * stage". They land here: a create affordance beside the heading and a per-book action menu, both
 * dispatching through {@link useAddressBookActions} (the outbox, not the network).
 *
 * The shape is the one macOS Contacts uses for its sidebar lists — a quiet "+" on the section header,
 * and the per-row actions kept out of the way until the row is pointed at or focused (always visible
 * under a coarse pointer, where there is no hover to reveal them with).
 *
 * RIGHTS-AWARE: a book the user cannot write to (`myRights.mayWrite === false`) carries a discreet
 * read-only marker and offers no rename; one that cannot be deleted (`mayDelete === false`, or the
 * account's default book, which the server will not destroy) offers no delete.
 *
 * **The read-only half is a VORLEISTUNG — anticipatory, and today unreachable in the browser.** No
 * book this rail can show can carry `mayWrite: false`: the reader's own books are all writable, and
 * a book shared WITH them lives in the owner's account, which this screen never asks about. That is
 * finding R-104 of the 2026-09-01 review (multi-account contacts), and it is open; until it lands,
 * the marker, the suppressed rename and the locked forms cannot be produced by any sequence of
 * clicks. This is written down rather than deleted because unreachable code is code nobody
 * maintains: when R-104 arrives, the first shared book must find this working and not rotting.
 * `AddressBookList.test.tsx` and `ContactForm.test.tsx` therefore drive it from a SYNTHETIC book
 * with the right switched off — those tests are the only thing holding it up (N-06).
