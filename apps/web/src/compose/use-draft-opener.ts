/**

 * row: `flushDraft` reads `serverEmailId` to send `priorServerId` (so the save REPLACES rather than
 * creates), and `discard` reads it to dispatch `discardDraft` at all. Measured against the fixture,
 * 2026-08-22, opening a draft that had no local copy — one written on another device, or here before
 * the browser data was cleared:
 *
 *  - **Discard did nothing to the server.** The window closed, the confirmation disappeared, and the
 *    draft was still in the Drafts folder. That is the reported bug.
 *  - **Close left a SECOND draft.** The save had no prior id, so the server created a new message
 *    beside the untouched original. Open-and-close a few times and the folder fills with copies of
 *    the same unfinished mail — which is what the folder in the report looked like.
 *
 * Written here rather than lazily at the first flush because both paths out of the window (save and
 * discard) need it, and one of them — discard — never flushes.
 *
 * Not fatal if it fails: the draft is open and readable, and the failure mode is the one that has
 * been shipping. The window is not torn down for a write that only affects what happens later.
