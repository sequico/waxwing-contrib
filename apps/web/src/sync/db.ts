/**
 * Local replica schema (M1.2, FR-OFF-02 basis, FR-AUTH-07 account-scoping, tech-stack §4.3).
 *
 * Waxwing is local-first: the UI never renders from network responses directly. The sync
 * engine (M1.3) maintains a partial replica of server state in this Dexie/IndexedDB database
 * keyed by JMAP state strings, and the UI subscribes to it via liveQuery. This module owns the
 * SCHEMA only — the row shapes, the account-scoped indexes, the JMAP→row mappers, and open/wipe.
 * Sync (delta fetch, outbox replay) and the list/tree views are layered on in M1.3 / M1.5 / M1.6.
 *
 * ## Account scoping (ADR-008, precedent ADR-004)
 * Every data table carries an `accountId` and is keyed `[accountId+id]` so a second account is
 * purely additive (FR-AUTH-07: "the data layer must be account-scoped from day one"). Unlike the
 * auth {@link SecretStore} — which uses a *separate encrypted database per account* (ADR-004)
 * because it holds secrets — the replica is a non-sensitive cache with an `accounts` registry, so
 * a single shared `waxwing-replica` database with compound keys is the better fit (ADR-008).
 * Per-account eviction is {@link clearAccount}; a full wipe (FR-AUTH-05) is {@link wipeReplica}.
 *
 * ## Multi-valued membership indexes
 * JMAP emails belong to many mailboxes (`mailboxIds`) and carry many `keywords`; IndexedDB has no
 * compound-multiEntry index, so folder/keyword membership is indexed via two derived multiEntry
 * arrays whose values embed the account id — `amb` = `"<accountId>\0<mailboxId>"`, `akw` =
 * `"<accountId>\0<keyword>"` — kept in sync by {@link toEmailRow}. That keeps "emails in mailbox X
 * for account A" a single indexed range with no cross-account bleed. The *ordered* list itself
 * (respecting the server's collation) comes from {@link QueryCacheRow.ids}, not a local re-sort.
 *
 * ## Migration policy
 * The `version()` chain is append-only and never destructive: bump to the next integer and add a
 * new `.stores({...})` (with a `.upgrade()` for any data transform) — never rename a store or drop
 * data in place. A store listed again in a later version with a changed index set migrates its
 * indexes automatically; omit a store entirely only to delete it deliberately. Because the replica
 * is a rebuildable cache, a breaking change may alternatively bump the DB *name* and let the old
 * database be garbage-collected, but that is a last resort — prefer an additive version bump.
 *
 * A purely ADDITIVE, NON-INDEXED, OPTIONAL row field needs **no** version bump: Dexie's schema
 * declares indexes, not value shapes, so a new field simply appears on rows written from now on and
 * reads as `undefined` on legacy rows (every reader must tolerate that). Precedent: `DraftRow.
 * errorKind` (M2.8) and `OutboxRow.undo`/`conflict`/`nextAttemptAt`/`refreshes` (M3.3) — all served
 * by the existing `[accountId+status]` / `[accountId+createdAt]` indexes. Bump the version only when
 * an INDEX changes or stored data must be transformed.
 *
 * An INDEXED field is NOT exempt from a version bump (precedent: `EmailBodyRow.bytes` /
 * `BlobMetaRow.bytes`, M3.4): IndexedDB omits a record that LACKS the index's key path from that
 * index ENTIRELY, so legacy rows would be silently invisible to every query served by it — here,
 * both cache metering and LRU eviction. Adding an index therefore always means "the stored data must
 * be transformed": bump the version and backfill the field in `.upgrade()`.
 *
 * **An `.upgrade()` callback must be TOTAL — it may never throw.** A throw inside `modify()` aborts
 * the upgrade transaction, so `db.open()` rejects; and since the version is fixed in the code, it
 * rejects again on every subsequent start. Nothing in the app rebuilds the replica when that happens,
 * so a single malformed legacy row would leave the user with an app that never loads again. Derive
 * defensively (a wrong byte estimate is a rounding error) and wrap each row transform in a try/catch.

 * them with the ids actually being undone (a partial rejection undoes a subset). A destination window

 *    a rejected save. Crash-restore reopens these rows: the text exists nowhere else.
 *  - `synced` — the row IS the server copy; nothing is owed. Written when a save is confirmed, and
 *    when a Drafts message is opened into the composer (the row is created to CARRY the
 *    `serverEmailId`, and at that moment it is a copy of what the server has). Two readers depend on

 *    `flushDraft` skips the server round trip when the content still matches — which is why opening
 *    a draft and closing it again untouched must not cost a `create`+`destroy` (R-12).
 *  - `sending` — claimed by the send pipeline (M2.8). Not an editable draft any more: crash-restore
 *    skips it, and a concurrent save's reconcile must not overwrite the status back to `synced`.
 *  - `error` — the last server write for this row was REJECTED; `errorKind` says which pipeline
 *    stamped it. A `save` error still holds unsaved content (crash-restore reopens it); a `send`
 *    error is surfaced live by the notifier.

 * The sentinel is the empty string rather than `new Date(0).toISOString()`, which would be the same
 * silent "Jan 1, 1970" the check exists to stop, and rather than dropping the field, which the
 * `UTCDate` type does not allow. It is a valid IndexedDB key that sorts before every real stamp, so
 * an undated message lands at the end of a newest-first window instead of the top of it.
 *
 * NOT the whole of the fix: rows written before this existed are already in the replica, so the
 * render path refuses the same two classes on its own — see `mail/format-message-time.ts`.
