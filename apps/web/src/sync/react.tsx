// rather than below it: the PWA update prompt (`pwa/use-update-prompt.ts`), mounted above the auth
// gate so a first-time visitor still precaches the shell, and any future out-of-React teardown path.
// `useReplicaOptional()` returns `null` for them however correct their intent — which is exactly how
// M3.5's "open drafts are saved first" promise came to be wired to a no-op flush for five milestones.
//
// A module-level accessor is the same shape the engine (`setActiveEngine`) and the storage-full
// signal (`storage.ts`) already use for live sync state, and it is deliberately NOT reactive: the one
// caller reads it once, inside an event handler, at the moment the user accepts a reload.
//
// ONLY THE OUTERMOST PROVIDER CLAIMS IT (M4.4 Etappe 4). Since Etappe 3 the providers NEST: the shell
// re-scopes the mail panes to the acting account, and the sidebar gives every account's tree its own.
// On an account switch only the INNER provider's effect re-runs, so an unconditional claim would
// leave `activeReplica` pointing at the SHARED account permanently — the outer primary provider's
// effect does not re-run to restore it. `flushActiveDraft` (`compose/use-draft-sync.ts`), which is
// M3.5's "open drafts are saved first" promise, would then `putDraft` into `drafts[sharedAccountId]`
// while `useDraftSync` reads `drafts[primaryAccountId]`: the exact data loss M3.10 fixed, reintroduced
// by nesting. `getActiveReplica()` means THE APP's replica, and only the outermost provider is that —
// a nested provider is a SCOPE, not the app.
