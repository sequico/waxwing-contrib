/**
 * Action queue / outbox (M1.3 skeleton, M3.3 hardening — FR-OFF-03, FR-ORG-01, FR-LST-04). Every
 * write — even "mark read" — is a JMAP `set` intent with a client id: it is applied to the replica
 * optimistically (instant UI), enqueued durably, then replayed against the server.
 *
 * ## Idempotence is a property of the intent, not of this module (ADR-038)
 * This header used to say "an idempotent JMAP `set` intent", full stop, and the retry paths below
 * are written on that sentence. It is true of every UPDATE and every DESTROY — re-sending "set
 * `$seen`", "move to Archive" or "destroy e1" costs nothing and converges — and it is FALSE of the
 * CREATE family (`saveDraft`, `createMailbox`, `createContactCard`, `createAddressBook`, and
 * `sendEmail`, which this module has always treated separately). RFC 8620 §5.3 scopes creation ids
 * to a single request, so JMAP offers no key that would let the server recognise a re-sent create as
 * the same one. If the response to a create is LOST — the connection drops after the server
 * processed it, or the tab dies mid-request — the next pass sends it again and the outcome depends
 * on the type: a second server draft, a second address book, or a rejection (`uid` / sibling-name
 * uniqueness) that dead-letters an action which in fact SUCCEEDED. See
 * `docs/adr/038-creates-are-not-idempotent-and-jmap-offers-no-key.md` for the options and why none
 * of them is a comment-sized change.
 *
 * ## The M3.3 contract (never silent data loss)
 *  - **Durable undo.** {@link applyOptimistic} returns an {@link OutboxUndo} *value* (not a closure)
 *    that is persisted on the row. `status === 'error' && undo != null` ⇒ *a rollback is still
 *    OWED*; {@link drainOwedUndos} retries it at the start of every pass, and it is nulled only once
 *    applied. So a rollback survives a reload, a tab hand-over and an outage.
 *  - **Transient ≠ failed.** A network/5xx/429/`serverFail` failure backs the row off and leaves it
 *    `pending` — FOREVER if need be. It is never rolled back and never dead-lettered.
 *  - **Per-object rejections.** A rejection is classified and undone PER FAILED ID: a 500-id destroy
 *    with one `notFound` no longer restores 500 messages, and `notFound` on a destroy is a SUCCESS
 *    ("already gone"), not a resurrection.
 *  - **Dead letters are surfaced.** A row that fails permanently is rolled back, marked `error` with
 *    an {@link OutboxConflict}, and shown to the user (retry / discard) — never silently retried,
 *    never silently dropped.
 *  - **"Instant UI" includes the LIST** (M3.8/M3.10). The list renders the cached `queryCache` window,
 *    not a local re-sort of `emails`, so an optimistic move/destroy/**keyword change** prunes the
 *    message out of the windows it left — in the SAME transaction as the envelope patch (see
 *    {@link updateWindows}). Without that an archived row only vanished when the server's push echoed
 *    the change back: never offline, and not at all if the archive beat the push channel's connect.
 *    A keyword change reaches the same windows through {@link filterPinsKeyword}: marking a message
 *    read prunes it out of `is:unread`, stripping a label prunes it out of that `?label=` view, and a
 *    keyword the window SORTS on ({@link sortUsesKeyword}, the "Unread first" toggle) voids its
 *    baseline so the server re-places the row — whether or not that window currently LISTS the message,
 *    because a keyword sort is also how a message arrives in one. The ARRIVAL half is symmetric where
 *    it can be: a move
 *    into a window whose filter and sort are locally reproducible SPLICES the row in
 *    ({@link placeArrival}) instead of only voiding — offline nothing else ever would, which made
 *    Undo look broken.
 *
 * Classification lives in `conflict.ts`, the retry curve in `backoff.ts`; this module owns the
 * replica mutations and the queue state machine.

// The cached list windows (M3.8) — the OTHER half of an optimistic move/destroy.
//
// The message list renders `queryCache[key].ids` VERBATIM (the server-ordered window; `emails` is a
// row cache, never a local re-sort). So patching `emails.mailboxIds` was only half the apply: until
// the WINDOW drops the id, an archived message keeps rendering in the folder it just left — and
// nothing local ever fixed that. `dispatch` triggers a REPLAY-ONLY pass (no `reconcileWatched`), so
// the row disappeared only when the SERVER's push echoed the change back: never while offline, and
// not at all when the archive happened before the push channel finished connecting.
//
// THE INVARIANT THAT MAKES THAT SAFE (and the one whose absence broke Undo — see below):
//
//   A window whose cached `ids` we edited locally, or whose membership we know is about to change
//   but cannot place, is no longer the baseline `Email/queryChanges` computes its delta against.
//   Its `queryState` MUST be voided (`null` ⇒ `reconcileQuery` takes the `fullRequery` branch).
//
// Why it is not optional: archive `e1` (the Inbox window drops the id), then Undo — which dispatches
// the INVERSE move, archive → inbox. Server-side the message leaves the Inbox and comes straight back:
// a NET-ZERO change. `queryChanges` since the state we still held truthfully reports "nothing changed",
// that empty delta is applied to our already-pruned `ids`, and the Inbox window stays PERMANENTLY short
// of a message that is sitting in the Inbox — the Undo button is decorative. Voiding the state costs a
// full re-query of one window; keeping it costs a wrong list.
//
// THE ARRIVAL HALF, and why it needed its own answer (M3.10, gap B2).
//
// Until M3.10 a departure was pruned locally but an ARRIVAL only voided the baseline and waited for a
// re-query — and OFFLINE there is nothing to re-query (`runReplay` puts the whole replay +
// `reconcileWatched` block behind `isOnline()`; engine.ts). So archiving a message offline made the row
// vanish instantly, and UNDOING it put the message back in the replica but NOT back in the list until
// reconnect. The Undo button worked and looked broken, which is worse than not working.
//
// So a locally computable arrival IS now spliced in — under a gate that refuses everything it cannot
// evaluate ({@link placeArrival}):
//   - the window's whole filter must be evaluable against the envelope ({@link windowAcceptsLocally}),
//   - every comparator must be one we can reproduce ({@link localSortKey}: `receivedAt`, `size`,
//     `hasKeyword` — never `from`/`subject`, whose collation is the server's),
//   - every neighbour in the window must have its envelope in the replica (a window is written BEFORE
//     its envelopes — backfill.ts — so this is a real, transient state, not a theoretical one),
//   - under `collapseThreads` the arriving message's thread must not already be represented.
// Any failure ⇒ exactly the old behaviour, void-only. The window is ALSO voided on success: our index
// is a good guess, not the server's answer, and `queryChanges` against a baseline whose ids we edited
// is the lie the invariant above forbids. `fullRequery` replaces `ids` wholesale (delta.ts), so
// insert-then-requery converges and can never duplicate.
//
// TWO THINGS THIS IS HONEST ABOUT rather than claiming to have solved:
//  - Under `collapseThreads` — which is the DEFAULT for every folder list (backfill.ts, and
//    `use-message-list.ts` passes `collapseThreads: !flat` with `flat` false) — the POSITION is a
//    guess too, not only the preview line. The server orders collapsed results by a key it picks for
//    the THREAD, which need not be the representative envelope it handed us. This is a heuristic that
//    the next reconcile corrects, and it beats showing nothing at all. Do not call it provable.
//  - Online the correction is DOUBLE-gated: `runReplay` only calls `reconcileWatched` once the outbox
//    queue has DRAINED (engine.ts). During a triage burst a locally placed row keeps our index across
//    several passes. That is the point — it is coherent and it is there — but it is not "one pass".
//
// The window's LENGTH is deliberately preserved on an incomplete window: the splice is followed by
// dropping the last id. A cached window is the head page `position: 0` of the server's result, and
// `loadMore` pages by `position: ids.length` (backfill.ts) — so pushing the oldest loaded row out of
// the slice is exactly what the server did, and it is re-fetched at that same position. Letting
// `ids.length` grow instead would ratchet `reconcileQuery`'s `windowLimit`
// (`Math.max(row.ids.length, DEFAULT_WINDOW_LIMIT)`, delta.ts) up by one PERMANENTLY per arrival, and
// would re-arm `MessageList`'s load-more guard (which keys off `ids.length`). A COMPLETE window
// (`ids.length >= total`) keeps every id — there is no page behind it to push a row into.

 * filter too (a SEARCH window is the general case, and since M-13 a folder window's own filter is
 * `AND(inMailbox, notKeyword $snoozed)`), so a message that fails one of those conditions does not
 * belong in the window and must not be spliced into it. The `after`/`before` arms below are what a
 * folder filter used to need and a search filter still does (`before:`/`after:` operators, M3.1).
 *
 * A strict ALLOW-LIST over the condition KEYS, and it must stay one. `false` here means "not proven",
 * which conflates "does not match" with "cannot tell" — sound only under `AND` (an unprovable branch
 * makes the whole conjunction unprovable, so we fall back to the void). That is why `OR` and `NOT` are
 * refused outright rather than given `some`/negation semantics, and why the free-text and header
 * conditions (`text`, `body`, `from`, `subject`, `header`, `hasAttachment`, the three thread-level
 * keyword conditions, `inMailboxOtherThan`, `minSize`/`maxSize`) all fall through to `false`: the
 * server owns their semantics, and a wrong `true` renders a row that does not belong in the list.
 *
 * `EmailFilterCondition` may carry SEVERAL keys on one object, implicitly ANDed (RFC 8621 §4.4.1), so
 * every present key is checked — an unknown one anywhere refuses the whole condition. Values are
 * type-narrowed rather than trusted: this filter was persisted by an older build and read back.

 * `from`-sorted list — costs no envelope read at all. Only then are the neighbours loaded, once per
 * window rather than once per arrival, inside the caller's transaction.
 *
 * ORDER — decided, not accidental (gap B8, where a bulk move first reached this with a window that
 * already holds part of the batch):
 *  - The arrivals are placed in the INTENT's order and are deliberately NOT pre-sorted by
 *    {@link localSortKey}. Each placement recomputes its index against the RUNNING `ids`, so placing
 *    one arrival does shift the index computed for the next; there is no batch-computed index to go
 *    stale. On a COMPLETE window that makes the result an insertion sort, and therefore independent of
 *    the order the ids arrive in AS LONG AS THEIR SORT KEYS ARE DISTINCT (pinned by the tests).
 *    TIES ARE ORDER-DEPENDENT, and that is not a rounding error: {@link placeArrival} scans for the
 *    first neighbour the arrival sorts STRICTLY before (`compareSortKeys(...) < 0`), so an arrival
 *    lands AFTER every equal neighbour — including one placed a moment earlier in the same batch. Two
 *    ids delivered in the same second (the normal case for bulk mail, not a contrived one) therefore
 *    come out in intent order: `[e1,e2]` gives `…e1,e2`, `[e2,e1]` gives `…e2,e1`. Benign, and pinned
 *    by a test rather than wished away: the window is voided on every insert, so the server's
 *    `fullRequery` replaces `ids` wholesale and decides the tie itself.
 *  - Sorting first would be strictly WORSE on an incomplete window: place newest-first and each insert
 *    shortens the tail under the arrivals still to come, so one that now sorts past the last loaded row
 *    is refused ({@link placeArrival}) and its match never reaches `total`. The intent order had
 *    already made room for it.
 *  - The tail-drop rule is paid PER INSERT, not per transaction, so `ids.length` is preserved after N
 *    arrivals exactly as it is after one — a 50-id move into a 20-long incomplete window leaves it 20
 *    long, each insert evicting the current last id — which ACROSS THE BATCH may be an arrival placed
 *    a moment ago, even though within a single {@link placeArrival} call it never is.

 * (`upToId === ids.at(-1)`; backfill/loadMore/reconcile). `entered` windows GAIN the ids when

 * their ids untouched; `resorted` windows always keep theirs. All three void `queryState` (see the
 * invariant above) — including a successful local insert, whose index is our guess and not the
 * server's answer. A window whose `ids` did NOT actually change keeps its state, because its baseline
 * is still honest.
 *
 * `entered` IS gated on membership — PER ID (gap B8) — and `resorted` is NOT, and the asymmetry is
 * the point:
 *  - `entered` is about FILTER arrival, so it is asked only of windows still MISSING at least one of
 *    the touched ids. A window that already holds ALL of them has taken them in; there is nothing left
 *    to splice. Per ID rather than per window because a bulk move is ONE call: a window listing `e1`
 *    but not `e2` must still pick `e2` up, and the whole-window quantifier placed neither.
 *  - `resorted` is about COLLATION, which is not a property of the rows a window happens to have
 *    loaded. Gating it on membership concealed a whole case: a message can arrive in a window BY SORT.
 *    An "Unread first" folder window (filter `AND(inMailbox, after)`, sort `hasKeyword $seen`) whose
 *    loaded slice stops before `e1` must show `e1` at the TOP the moment `e1` is marked unread from
 *    somewhere else — a search result, a label view. Under the old gate `resorted` was not asked (the
 *    window does not list `e1`) and `entered` was false (a folder window carries a keyword SORT, not a
 *    keyword FILTER), so nothing voided and the row appeared only at the next full reconcile: online
 *    when the server's push echoed, offline not until reconnect. The question is therefore asked of
 *    every window, and the answer is the same either way — if a window's order depends on this
 *    keyword, then any change to that keyword on any message that could belong to it makes our
 *    baseline a lie, whether or not the id is currently listed.
 *
 * That price is real and was weighed, not overlooked: with "Unread first" ON, every mark-read voids
 * the folder window the user is looking at and buys one `fullRequery`. It is honest — they turned on a
 * sort that depends on read state, so changing read state genuinely must re-sort — and it is bounded,
 * because `runReplay` only reconciles once `pendingOutbox` is empty (engine.ts), so a triage burst
 * collapses into ONE re-query rather than one per keystroke. With the toggle OFF (the default)
 * {@link sortUsesKeyword} is false and nothing is voided at all, so the cost is strictly opt-in.
 *
 * A window is still never scanned twice and never voided twice: an `entered` window that also
 * `resorted` is written exactly once, by the insert (or by the insert's fallback void).
 *
 * MUST run inside the caller's transaction, together with the `emails` mutation it mirrors: a crash
 * between the two would leave a window listing a message that has moved out from under it.

 *     "from Inbox" routinely contains ids that were never in the Inbox. Debiting for them takes the
 *     badge below the truth for messages the folder never held.
 *
 * The `from` gate is the reason three call sites hand this function a membership record carrying an
 * explicit `false` rather than an absent key ({@link applyOptimistic}'s move via `hadFrom`,
 * {@link applyUndo}'s `mailboxIds` case and {@link unsentCountDeltas}'s move branch): `hadFrom` is
 * persisted on the outbox row for precisely this gate to consume. On the rollback path the gate is

 * Apply a count delta to the mailbox rows — a DELTA PATCH, deliberately not a recompute (M3.10, gap

 *
 * WHY NOT A RECOMPUTE. `db.emails` is a bounded, actively-SHRINKING horizon, not the folder:
 * `maintenance.ts` bulk-deletes the envelopes past `cacheDays + grace` that no live window holds. A
 * local `count()` over a 50k-message Inbox is not merely stale, it is categorically wrong — it would
 * replace a briefly stale badge with a permanently and confidently wrong one. (M-13 removed the date
 * bound from the QUERY, which changes nothing here: the query pages 50 at a time, so the replica
 * still holds a fraction of a large folder, and the prune horizon is untouched.) (`labelUnreadCounts` in `repo.ts` DOES
 * recompute, and its own doc admits it "reflects only the windowed replica subset": a label is a
 * client-side concept whose carriers are mostly recent. `Mailbox.unreadEmails` is a server-owned
 * absolute over mail this client has never seen, and the only sound local edit to it is ±1.) A
 * hybrid — recompute unread, patch total — is rejected for making one row's two numbers answer to
 * two different authorities.
 *
 * NO DEFENSIVE BOOKKEEPING IS NEEDED AGAINST THE SERVER: `patchMailboxes`/`putMailboxes` (delta.ts)
 * assign the server's ABSOLUTE number, never combine it arithmetically, so a delta that reports the
 * mailbox erases whatever we patched. What that costs instead is durability, which is why
 * {@link reapplyPendingCounts} exists.
 *
 * `Math.max(0, …)` on BOTH fields, for the same reason `updateWindows` clamps `window.total`: the
 * replica may hold a message the server's count does not reflect yet, so a decrement can outrun the
 * number it is decrementing.
 *
 * `get`-then-`put` rather than `update` because the new value is a FUNCTION OF THE OLD ONE
 * (`old + delta`, clamped), and `update` has no way to express that — it can only assign a value the
 * caller already knows, which we do not. The read is the point; the `put` is just how the computed
 * row goes back. It is NOT what stops a mailbox a concurrent `Mailbox/changes` destroyed from being
 * resurrected — an earlier version of this comment claimed that and was wrong. Dexie's
 * `Table.update()` on a missing primary key is a documented no-op returning 0 and never inserts, so
 * `update` would resurrect nothing either. The protection against the destroyed mailbox is the
 * `if (row === undefined) continue` guard below, and nothing else.
 *
 * `totalThreads`/`unreadThreads` are deliberately LEFT ALONE. They are server-owned, no surface
 * reads them, and — decisively — a per-MESSAGE mutation cannot imply a thread-count delta at all:
 * moving one message out of a three-message thread changes `totalThreads` by 0, not by 1, and there
 * is no local way to tell those two cases apart on a partial replica.
 *
 * BEHAVIOUR CHANGE, deliberate: the three non-badge readers of `totalEmails` — the delete-folder
 * confirmation (`FolderTree.tsx`), the empty-folder confirmation (`cleanup/CleanupDialogs.tsx`) and
 * `demo/MailboxListView.tsx` (static demo fixtures, which this code never reaches) — now quote the
 * OPTIMISTIC total. That is correct (they should reflect what the user just did), but the
 * delete-folder dialog is where an over-count would produce a scarier confirmation than reality.
 *
 * MUST run inside the caller's transaction, with `db.mailboxes` in scope, together with the envelope
 * mutation it mirrors — a crash between the two would leave the badge disagreeing with the list.

 * Three narrowings, each load-bearing:
 *  1. {@link unsentOutbox}, NOT `pendingOutbox` — and its test is `pending` AND `attempts === 0`,
 *    not `pending` alone. `pending` in this state machine means "not currently dispatched", not
 *    "never dispatched": `recoverStranded`, the transient-retry branch, auth expiry AND the
 *    per-object `rateLimit` retry all return an already-dispatched row to `pending` — four paths,
 *    not the three an earlier version of this list named — and a row whose request DID reach the
 *    server has its ±1
 *    in the server's number already. Adding it again double-counts, and unlike staleness a
 *    double-count never self-corrects. The predicate fails CLOSED for exactly that reason — see
 *    {@link unsentOutbox} for the full argument and the residual `inflight` gap it accepts.
 *  2. Only the FIELDS the pass actually wrote ({@link MailboxCountWrites}). `syncMailboxes` patches
 *    only the mailboxes `Mailbox/changes` reports and only the properties it names, so a pass that
 *    left a mailbox alone must NOT have the delta added a second time on top of the patch already
 *    sitting in the row. The two halves are INDEPENDENT and both reachable: `Mailbox/changes` names
 *    `totalEmails` without `unreadEmails` whenever a READ message enters or leaves a folder, and
 *    `unreadEmails` without `totalEmails` on every remote mark-read.
 *  3. The delta is re-DERIVED from the persisted undo plus the current envelopes, not remembered —
 *    the undo is the only durable record, and it already carries exactly the gates the forward
 *    arithmetic uses (`had`, `hadTo`, `hadFrom`).
 *
 * The collision this fixes is common, not exotic: new mail arriving in the Inbox IS a server-side
 * change to the Inbox, and the Inbox is where marking-read happens.

/**
 * Re-apply the STRUCTURAL effect of unsent mailbox intents, over a folder list a `syncMailboxes`
 * pass has just rewritten with the server's ABSOLUTE one (B55).
 *
 * ## The gap this closes
 *
 * {@link reapplyPendingCounts} beside it covers the count FIELDS. Nothing covered the rows
 * themselves — a folder created or deleted through the UI is applied optimistically while its
 * intent waits in the outbox, and a delta pass that reports the mailbox list writes the server's
 * version over it: the created folder disappears, the deleted one COMES BACK. It comes back and
 * stays, because the replay that would make the server agree runs after the pass, and once the
 * intent lands nothing re-reports the mailbox again.
 *
 * That is not theoretical. It is the failure the M5-era concurrency experiment produced against the
 * live fixture — "a folder deleted through the UI came back, and stayed" — which is why that
 * experiment was reverted, and why `engine.ts` records the concurrency as BLOCKED on this function
 * existing rather than as rejected.
 *
 * ## The same three narrowings, for the same reasons
 *
 * {@link unsentOutbox}, not `pendingOutbox`: only intents that have PROVABLY never been dispatched.
 * An intent the server may already have processed must not be re-applied — for a create/destroy the
 * server's list is then the truth, and re-applying would resurrect a folder the server has actually
 * deleted (or hide one it has actually created) until something changes the mailbox again.
 *
 * Unlike the counts, there is no per-field narrowing to make: `syncMailboxes` either reports a
 * mailbox or it does not, and the re-apply is idempotent in both directions — putting a row that is
 * already there, or deleting one that is already gone, is a no-op. That is why this needs no
 * equivalent of `MailboxCountWrites`.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * Rename and re-parent are left to the count-free path they already had: `patchMailboxes` assigns
 * the server's absolute `name`/`parentId`, so an unsent rename does revert until it lands — the
 * same accepted staleness B18 records for the badges, and self-correcting in the same way. Only
 * EXISTENCE is restored here, because existence is the one that does not self-correct: a
 * resurrected folder is a row the user deleted, sitting in their tree, indefinitely.

 *  - a refused source flag is rolled BACK from the row's persisted undo, exactly as a REJECTED send
 *    rolls it back. Re-queuing the patch is the alternative and it is worse: it failed for a reason
 *    that will not change (the source is gone, or the account may not write it), and a dead letter

 * Recover intents stranded `inflight` by a leader killed mid-request. Re-sending an idempotent `set`

 * dead-lettered with the `sendInterrupted` CODE ("was it sent?") instead of auto-resent (M2.8) — the
 * user decides via the reopened draft.
 *
 * A CREATE is not idempotent either, and this line does not yet act on that (ADR-038). A stranded
 * `saveDraft`/`createMailbox`/`createContactCard`/`createAddressBook` goes back to `pending` and is
 * re-sent, which duplicates the object (drafts, address books) or is rejected for a uniqueness the
 * FIRST attempt established (`uid`, sibling names) and dead-lettered as if it had failed. Treating
 * it like `sendEmail` is NOT the answer: a create is dispatched by autosave on every idle pause, so
 * dead-lettering one per dropped connection would make offline-first drafting unusable. The fix
 * needs a server-side existence probe before the RE-send, which is a design decision rather than a
 * patch — see the ADR. Nothing here is a mitigation; this note exists so the next reader does not
 * mistake the `sendEmail` special case for the whole of the problem.
 *
 * `attempts` IS INCREMENTED on the way back to `pending`. A stranded row was dispatched — the
 * request went out and we simply never learned its fate — so recording the attempt is true on its
 * own terms. It is also load-bearing: {@link unsentOutbox} reads `attempts === 0` as "provably never
 * dispatched", and without the increment this function would launder a dispatched row into a set
 * whose whole purpose is to exclude it, double-counting its ±1 on top of a server number that may
 * already contain it. Note the asymmetry with the safety argument one line up: a re-sent `set` is
 * harmless BECAUSE it is idempotent, and a ±1 count delta is precisely the thing that is not.
 *
 * TWO REAL SIDE EFFECTS, both accepted. A row stranded {@link STUCK_AFTER_ATTEMPTS} times is now
 * REPORTED as stuck — which is accurate (it has been dispatched six times and never settled) and
 * costs nothing but a "still trying" notice; it is never discarded or rolled back. And the next
 * transient failure's backoff is computed from the higher counter, so it waits one step longer.
 * Neither delays THIS recovery: `nextAttemptAt` is untouched, so the row is ready immediately.
