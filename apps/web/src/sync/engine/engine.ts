/**
 * The sync-engine facade (M1.3, hardened in M3.3). One instance runs per tab; only the
 * {@link startLeaderElection} leader actually syncs — followers reflect the leader's status off the
 * {@link EngineBus} while reading the same replica via Dexie's cross-tab liveQuery. The leader:
 *  - opens a push channel (SSE-first per D2) and, on every `StateChange`, runs a delta {@link sync};
 *  - runs an initial sync (mailbox pull → inbox backfill → email/thread delta) on becoming leader;
 *  - runs a periodic safety sweep — the polling fallback AND the SP.4 "absence ≠ freshness"
 *    re-probe (every Nth sweep forces a full query re-reconcile);
 *  - replays the outbox — after every sync AND on demand ({@link requestReplay}), so a queued action
 *    never waits for a full delta round-trip, and a FOLLOWER's action wakes the leader over the bus.
 *
 * Everything external (locks, push, broadcast, clock, online-ness, randomness) is injected so the
 * whole loop — including offline/online flapping and retry backoff — is hermetically testable with
 * fakes; {@link createSyncEngine} fills the browser defaults.

 * a CORS blip) would spend the failover budget and strand the channel on the WebSocket — which is

 * order self-heals. Restricting the set instead keeps SSE last-real, so it retries forever.

// WHY A KEYED MAP, NOT A SECOND POINTER. The sidebar renders one `FolderTree` per account AT ONCE
// (`mail/AccountTrees.tsx`), each under its own `ReplicaProvider` — a shared account's tree the user
// is not currently "in" is still on screen and still clickable (rename, delete, empty-folder). So
// "which engine is active?" is not a well-formed question: at any instant there are N right answers.
// The engine a call uses is the one whose account matches the `useReplica().accountId` of the
// SUBTREE the call is made in, which is what `getEngineFor` resolves.
//
// WHAT `getActiveEngine()` MEANS NOW: the PRIMARY engine, i.e. the user's own account. Three callers
// are entitled to it and no others should reach for the familiar name — `settings/StorageSection`
// (device-level maintenance), the `accountId === null` degrade below (a component rendered with no
// ReplicaProvider, which happens in component tests only), and the empty-registry fallback.
//
// WHY THE FALLBACK IS KEYED ON *EMPTY* AND NEVER ON A *MISS*. An empty registry means no fleet has
// published yet: the pre-M4.4 world, and the many component tests that call `setActiveEngine(fake)`
// with no account attached — answer with the primary and the single-account path stays byte-for-byte
// what it was. A MISS on a POPULATED registry means something else entirely: this account has no
// running engine (a share revoked mid-session, a teardown window). Then the answer is `null`, never a
// substitute, because JMAP mailbox ids are per-account and SHORT (`a`, `b`, …) — the primary almost
// always holds a real but DIFFERENT mailbox under the id the caller meant. Answering a miss with the
// primary IS the corruption this stage closes: changing that line back to `?? activeEngine` silently
// reopens it.
//
// Observable, and through the ONE listener set both mutators notify: React consumers (the message
// list's watch) must re-render the moment an engine appears, rather than racing the SyncEngineHost
// effect that publishes it — a null read would leave a watch unregistered and the window stuck.
