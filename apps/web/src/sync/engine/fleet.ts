/**
 * The per-account engine FLEET (M4.4 Etappe 2). One {@link SyncEngine} runs per mail account — the
 * user's own PRIMARY plus every delegated/shared account the session grants — so their mailbox trees
 * land in the (already account-scoped) replica for the sidebar (Etappe 3) to render.
 *
 * This module is the pure orchestration: it decides HOW MANY engines to run, WHICH leader lock each
 * holds, and WHERE their status goes — all through injected factories so it is testable without React
 * or a browser. {@link SyncEngineHost} (`react.tsx`) is the thin wrapper that fills the browser
 * factories and re-runs the whole thing on any account-set change (React's effect cleanup guarantees
 * a clean teardown before every rebuild — the 0→1→0 lifecycle).
 *
 * Two invariants shape every decision here:
 *  - **The primary is byte-for-byte the pre-M4.4 engine when NO account is shared.** With zero shared
 *    accounts nothing new happens: no push mux, no registry write, the bare {@link SYNC_LOCK}, the
 *    global status badge, the active-engine handle. The single-account path is exactly today's.
 *  - **Secondary engines never touch the primary's UX.** They hold their own `${SYNC_LOCK}:${id}`
 *    lock, a no-op status sink (no badge flicker) and a no-op bus (no cross-tab status/foreground
 *    crosstalk), and carry no notifier. That isolation is untouched — but every engine IS published
 *    under its own account id ({@link FleetDeps.publish}), because the UI dispatches through the
 *    engine matching the acting subtree's `useReplica().accountId`, not through one global pointer.
 *    Only the PRIMARY additionally becomes the `activeEngine` handle, which now means exactly "the
 *    user's own account" for the few account-global consumers.
 *
 * That last point is Etappe 4, and it closes the defect Etappe 3 made reachable: the grouped sidebar
 * put shared mailboxes on screen while every write still went to the single `activeEngine`. Because
 * JMAP mailbox ids are per-account and SHORT (`a`, `b`, …), an archive/move/empty performed in a
 * shared folder carried that account's id to the PRIMARY's engine — where it names a real but
 * DIFFERENT mailbox. Silent, and destructive in `emptyMailbox`'s case.
