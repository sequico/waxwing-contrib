 * which happens in component tests only; in the shell every mail pane runs inside one.
 *
 * The ONLY way a component may reach an engine. There is deliberately no ambient
 * `useActiveEngine()` any more: it was how every mail pane came to hold the primary's engine
 * regardless of the account it was rendering, and removing it means the compiler enumerates any
 * future attempt to go back. Out-of-React callers use `getActiveEngine()` (the primary, for
 * device-global work) or `getEngineFor(accountId)`.
 *
 * Reactive: a pane can mount before {@link SyncEngineHost}'s effect commits, and a one-shot `null`
 * read would leave its watch unregistered for the life of the pane — a list window that never
 * resolves.
 *
 * `accountId` is for callers that already hold the account explicitly (it arrived as a prop) rather
 * than through the provider.
