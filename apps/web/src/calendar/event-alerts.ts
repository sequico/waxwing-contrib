/**
 * Reminders on an event (K-5, FR-CAL-01) — reading them, offering a few, and **not losing the rest**.
 *
 * Until this file existed `alerts` was in no property list the client sent, so an alarm set on a
 * phone was invisible here. It survived a title change only by accident: `draftToEvent` is a JMAP
 * patch and never named the property. The moment the editor DOES name it, that accident stops
 * protecting anything and this module has to do it on purpose.
 *
 * **Two kinds of alert, and the split is the whole design.**
 *
 *  - **Modelled**: a `display` action on an `OffsetTrigger` relative to the start, with nothing else
 *    on it. Those the reader can see and change, and they are re-written from scratch on every save.
 *  - **Opaque**: everything else — `action: "email"`, an `AbsoluteTrigger`, a `relativeTo: "end"`,
 *    or an alert carrying a member this client does not model. Measured: Stalwart hands an
 *    `AbsoluteTrigger` back with an `iCalendar` sidecar
 *    (`{"convertedProperties":{"trigger":{"parameters":{"value":"DATE-TIME"}}},"name":"valarm"}`)
 *    that describes how the alarm was converted from a VALARM. Those are carried through **byte for
 *    byte under their original keys**, which is the same stance `EventFacts` takes on a location and
 *    an attendee list: what the editor cannot show, it also must not touch.
 *
 * The alternative — dropping what we do not understand — is the expensive kind of wrong. It looks
 * like nothing happened; the email reminder simply never fires again, months later, for somebody
 * who never opened this editor.
 *
 * **`undefined` is not `[]`.** {@link alertsToPatch} answers `undefined` for "not touched" (the
 * property stays out of the patch and the server leaves it alone) and `null` for "the reader
 * emptied it" (measured: `alerts: null` clears; so does `alerts: {}`, and `null` is the one RFC 8620
 * §5.3 names for removal). Getting that pair the wrong way round either destroys every alarm on
 * every save, or makes clearing one impossible.

/**
 * The offsets a WHOLE-DAY event may be reminded at, with the label each one means.
 *
 * A whole-day event starts at MIDNIGHT, so "on the day" has to name a morning hour or the alarm
 * fires while the reader is asleep. Apple picks 09:00 and states it in the label, which is why these
 * carry their own keys instead of being formatted from a count: "on the day of the event (9:00)" is
 * not "0 days before".
 *
 * **The arithmetic is `9h − 24h × n`, and the first value is POSITIVE.** 09:00 on the day itself is
 * nine hours AFTER midnight (`PT9H`); the day before is `9 − 24 = −15` hours; two days before is
 * `9 − 48 = −39`; a week before is `9 − 168 = −159`. `PLAN-kalender.md` gives this list as
 * `-PT9H`, `-PT33H`, `-PT57H` — that is `−(24n + 9)`, which places "on the day of the event" at
 * 15:00 the day BEFORE and shifts every entry a day early. The plan's `-PT9H` came from a reading of
 * `defaultAlertsWithoutTime`; on the v0.16.18 fixture that map is empty (`{}`) on every calendar, so
 * there was nothing there to read. All four values below round-trip through `CalendarEvent/set` and
 * `/get` unchanged, `PT9H` included (probed 21.08.2026).
