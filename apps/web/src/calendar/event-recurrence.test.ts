/**
 * Repetition and single-occurrence overrides (K-2, FR-CAL-01).
 *
 * **The brief for this work asked for a test proving an occurrence is patched by POINTER
 * (`"recurrenceOverrides/<rid>": {…}`) and never as the whole map. That test cannot be written,
 * because the server refuses the pointer.** Probed against Stalwart v0.16.18 on 21.08.2026, with a
 * throwaway account and a weekly series:
 *
 * ```jsonc
 * update: { "b": { "recurrenceOverrides/2026-09-14T09:00:00": { "excluded": true } } }
 * → notUpdated: { "b": { "type":"invalidProperties",
 *                        "description":"Patch operation failed.",
 *                        "properties":["recurrenceOverrides/2026-09-14T09:00:00"] } }
 * ```
 *
 * `recurrenceOverrides/<rid>/title` fails identically; `recurrenceRule/count` in the SAME request
 * succeeds, which is the control that makes this a fact about the property and not about patching.
 * The whole map, written as one value, is accepted and reads back verbatim.
 *
 * So the assertion the brief was really after — *"editing one occurrence must not destroy the
 * others"* — is tested here in the only form this server permits: the map is merged from what was
 * just read, every other entry survives byte for byte, and (in `calendar-series.test.ts`) the read
 * happens inside the same request as the write. A whole-map write measured against this server also
 * REPLACES: writing a map with one entry leaves exactly one entry, so a client that forgets to merge
 * silently deletes every other override in the series. That is the failure these tests guard.
