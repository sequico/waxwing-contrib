/**
 * Reminders (K-5) — and above all, the ones this client does NOT understand.
 *
 * The gap this closes is that `alerts` was in no property list the client sent, so an alarm set on a
 * phone was invisible in Waxwing. The risk that closing it creates is the opposite one: the moment
 * the editor names the property in a patch, everything it cannot model is one save away from being
 * deleted. So most of what is asserted below is about carrying things through unchanged.
 *
 * The fixtures are the shapes Stalwart v0.16.18 actually answered with on 21 August 2026, including
 * the `iCalendar` sidecar it attaches to an alert converted from a VALARM — a member no draft
 * mentions and the strongest reason the "is this one of ours?" test is a whitelist rather than a
 * blacklist.
