/**
 * The JMAP seam for calendars (M5.6, FR-CAL-01).
 *
 * The WRITE seam, and the read seam for anything the replica does not hold. Since K-8 the screen
 * reads its months from the replica (`use-calendar-events.ts`) and never from here; what is left on
 * this side is the calendar list, the writes (create/update/destroy, RSVP), the availability probe
 * and the `expandRecurrences` query the sync engine runs to fill that replica. Those need a line,
 * which is why the screen still gates them on `useOnline`.
 *
 * This file said "calendar data is not in the replica" until 2026-09-01, three weeks after K-8 put
 * it there. That sentence is how R-24 came about one screen over — somebody read the equivalent
 * line in `files-client.ts` and built a dialog on it.
 *
 * **Occurrences come from the server.** `expandRecurrences` returns one id per occurrence inside
 * the window, so a weekly meeting arrives as the individual instances it has in that month. The
 * alternative — expanding the rule here — means implementing recurrence in local time across DST
 * transitions, which is the part of calendaring that is genuinely hard and that the server has
 * already done correctly.
 *
 * **But an occurrence id is not an object id, and that distinction is the whole of T1.** The ids an
 * expanded query answers with are SYNTHETIC: they name "the instance of that event on that day",
 * which is a thing that exists only for the length of the answer. Stalwart says so out loud — a
 * `/set` addressed to one comes back `invalidProperties: "Updating synthetic ids is not yet
 * supported."` — and the same patch addressed to the real id is accepted without complaint.
 * Waxwing read with expansion and then wrote back with what it had read, so editing and deleting
 * failed for EVERY event, including plain single ones that have no recurrence at all.
 *
 * So the range query asks TWICE in one request: once expanded, which is what the grid draws, and
 * once unexpanded, which is what a write may address. The resulting {@link PlacedEvent.writeId} is
 * the ONLY id this module will write to. An occurrence that cannot be traced back to an object
 * carries `writeId: null` and is shown read-only, rather than being offered an editor whose Save
 * is guaranteed to fail.
 *
 * **The two answers are joined by a SIGNATURE, and NOT by `uid`.** RFC 8984 gives every event a
 * `uid` and every occurrence its master's, so a uid join is the obvious design — it is what the
 * first attempt at this fix did, and it left every event in the calendar read-only on the wire
 * while passing every unit test. Measured against Stalwart v0.16, here is why:
 *
 *  - `uid` comes back only for an event that HAS one stored. Anything written over CalDAV does
 *    (iCalendar requires it), and a `CalendarEvent/set` that names a `uid` keeps it.
 *  - A `CalendarEvent/set` that does NOT name one gets no uid — Stalwart mints none, and the .ics
 *    it then serves over CalDAV has no `UID` line either.
 *  - {@link draftToEvent} names no uid. So every event a reader creates HERE has none, and a uid
 *    join fails for exactly the events this editor exists to edit while working for everyone
 *    else's — the worst possible distribution of a bug, and precisely the one that shipped.
 *
 * Minting a uid on create would fix half of that and nothing about events already stored, so the
 * join has to hold without one. If it is ever added, it belongs beside the branches in
 * {@link resolveIdentity} as a more certain one — never as a replacement for them.
 *
 * **That more certain branch now exists, and it is `baseEventId`.** `draft-ietf-jmap-calendars`
 * defines it as "only defined if the `id` property is a synthetic id", and Stalwart sends it on
 * EVERY event an expanded query answers with — `{"id":"iaaaaaf","baseEventId":"f"}` — including
 * instances of events that repeat nothing, where it names the event itself. It is the server
 * stating the mapping the signature was reconstructing, so it is asked for and consulted first.
 * The signature stays exactly where it was, as the fallback for a server that does not send it:
 * it is measured behaviour on one version of one server, and deleting the join that works without
 * it would trade a guess for a different guess.
 *
 * What the server does send, for an occurrence of a non-repeating event, is the stored event's own
 * record with a synthetic `id` swapped in — compared field by field against the unexpanded answer.
 * So {@link eventSignature} is built from what the two demonstrably share: `start`, `duration`,
 * `title`, `calendarIds`, `showWithoutTime`. `timeZone` is deliberately NOT among them: the
 * expanded answer says `Etc/UTC` where a direct read of the same event says `null` (the same
 * discrepancy T12 found in the agenda), so including it would fail to resolve precisely the
 * whole-day and floating events.
 *
 * The join is deliberately conservative. Exactly one object carrying the signature is a write id;
 * none, or more than one, leaves `writeId: null`. Two genuinely indistinguishable events in the
 * same window make each other read-only instead of one becoming the target of the other's edit.
 * In doubt, do not write.
 *
 * **A series is refused either way, which is what makes that conservatism affordable.** Measured
 * with a weekly `RRULE` put in over CalDAV: every expanded occurrence carries `recurrenceId`, so
 * {@link refuseEdit} answers `series` for all of them. Their `start` differs from the master's
 * from the second occurrence on, so the signature resolves nothing — and the first occurrence,
 * which does resolve, is refused on the series flag before the write id is ever consulted. Worth
 * knowing while reading {@link indexObjects}: that same measurement showed the stored master
 * answering WITHOUT `recurrenceRules` even when asked for it. That is no longer a mystery — the
 * client was asking for the wrong property name. Stalwart implements
 * `draft-ietf-calext-jscalendarbis`, where the rule is SINGULAR (`recurrenceRule`, one object) and
 * not RFC 8984's `recurrenceRules` array; asked by its real name, the master answers. See
 * `docs/adr/025-jscalendarbis-is-the-wire-format.md`. The occurrence's `recurrenceId` still
 * carries most of the load, but the master's own answer is no longer a belt that was never
 * fastened — which matters the moment a series editor exists, because that editor starts from the
 * master.

 *    it resolves an occurrence the signature cannot, such as the second week of a series, where
 *    `start` has moved away from the master's.
 * 2. The id is itself an object id. A server that does not synthesise ids when expanding — which
 *    the spec permits — needs no mapping at all, and this keeps such a server working unchanged.
 * 3. Exactly one object in the same window carries the same {@link eventSignature}. This is what
 *    carried the whole feature before `baseEventId` was asked for, and it is the reason a whole
 *    month is still fetched both ways: it is the fallback for a server that omits it.
 * 4. None of those, or an ambiguous signature: `writeId` stays `null` and the screen says so,
 *    rather than offering a doomed editor or — far worse — writing the wrong event's id.
 *
 * `series` is taken from the MASTER wherever one was found, not from the occurrence alone: an
 * expanded instance is supposed to carry `recurrenceId`, and a client that believes only the
 * instance is one server quirk away from offering to edit a series in place. Note what `series`
 * is NOT taken from: `baseEventId` itself. Stalwart puts it on every expanded event, repeating or
 * not, so reading it as "this is a series" would make every single event in the month read-only.
