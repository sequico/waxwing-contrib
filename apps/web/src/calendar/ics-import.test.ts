/**
 * Reading a `.ics` into events (K-4, FR-CAL-01).
 *
 * **The assertion that matters is a count.** `CalendarEvent/parse` answers an ARRAY per blob, and a
 * client that reads it as an object keeps the first event and loses every other one — with no error
 * anywhere, on a file the reader watched themselves pick. The fixture below is the verbatim answer
 * v0.16.18 gave for a two-VEVENT `.ics` on 21.08.2026, and the test says: two rows.
 *
 * The second is the strip list. `method` is measured immutable on CREATE as well as on update
 * (`"This property is immutable."`), so a parsed invitation — which always carries
 * `method: "request"` — fails the whole create if it is left in.
