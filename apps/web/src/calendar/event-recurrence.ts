/**
 * Repetition, and changing one occurrence of it (K-2, FR-CAL-01).
 *
 * **The measurement that decided this file's design, and it contradicts the plan.**
 * `PLAN-kalender.md` states as a rule that "the overrides map must never be written back as a
 * whole — only as a pointer patch", and lists as its one open question whether a *patch* of
 * `{"excluded": true}` is accepted the way the same value is at create time. Probed against
 * Stalwart v0.16.18 on 21.08.2026:
 *
 * ```jsonc
 * update: { "b": { "recurrenceOverrides/2026-09-14T09:00:00": { "excluded": true } } }
 * → notUpdated: { "b": { "type": "invalidProperties",
 *                        "description": "Patch operation failed.",
 *                        "properties": ["recurrenceOverrides/2026-09-14T09:00:00"] } }
 *
 * update: { "b": { "recurrenceOverrides": { "2026-09-14T09:00:00": { "excluded": true } } } }
 * → updated: { "b": null }        // and it reads back exactly so
 * ```
 *
 * A pointer one level deeper (`recurrenceOverrides/<rid>/title`) is refused in the same words, and
 * — the control that makes this a fact about this property rather than about patching — a
 * `recurrenceRule/count` pointer in the very same request IS accepted. So the plan's rule is not
 * merely unnecessary here, it is **not implementable**: on this server the whole map is the only
 * way in.
 *
 * That leaves the danger the plan's rule existed to prevent, and it has to be handled rather than
 * wished away: a whole-map write sends back everything the client last read, so an override another
 * client added in between is lost. The mitigation is in `calendar-client.ts` — the map is READ in
 * the same JMAP request that writes it, never from the copy the screen is holding, so the window
 * shrinks from "however long the dialog was open" to the ordering of two calls inside one batch.
 * Entries are merged, not replaced, so the `updated` stamp the server writes into an override
 * survives.
 *
 * **The second trap is the key.** An override is keyed by the occurrence's ORIGINAL start. Once it
 * has been moved, the expansion reports the occurrence with `recurrenceId` equal to its NEW start:
 * measured, override key `2026-09-21T09:00:00`, expanded `recurrenceId: "2026-09-21T16:00:00"`. A
 * client that keys by the `recurrenceId` it was handed therefore writes a SECOND override on the
 * second edit and leaves the first behind — one occurrence becomes two. {@link overrideKeyFor}
 * looks the moved occurrence up in the stored map before believing what it was told.
