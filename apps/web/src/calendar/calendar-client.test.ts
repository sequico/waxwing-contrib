/**
 * The calendar seam on the wire (M5.6/M5.11, FR-CAL-01) — and above all, **which id it writes to**.
 *
 * This file exists because of T1. The month view is fetched with `expandRecurrences: true`, which
 * makes the server answer with one id per OCCURRENCE — `eaaaaa0`, not `0` — and the screen then
 * wrote back with the id it had just read. Stalwart refuses that (`invalidProperties`, "Updating
 * synthetic ids is not yet supported."), so editing and deleting failed for every event in the
 * calendar, including plain single ones that repeat nothing. The same patch addressed to the real
 * id was accepted without complaint: it was never the body, only the id.
 *
 * So the assertions here are about identity rather than about shapes. The load-bearing ones:
 *
 *  - the range query asks the server BOTH ways, in one request;
 *  - a write addresses the id from the unexpanded answer and never the one the grid drew with;
 *  - an occurrence that cannot be traced back to an object is not writable at all, rather than
 *    writable-and-refused;
 *  - and an occurrence that could be traced to TWO objects is not writable either.
 *
 * The join itself is a SIGNATURE and not `uid`, which is the correction this file also pins. The
 * first fix for T1 joined on `uid` and was green here while every event stayed read-only against
 * the real server: measured, Stalwart returns a `uid` only for an event that has one stored, and
 * an event created through this client has none, because `draftToEvent` names none and the server
 * mints none. So the fixtures below carry no `uid` at all — a fixture richer than the server is
 * how a client passes its tests and fails its users.
 *
 * The client is a hand-rolled fake of the `call()`/`request()` seam rather than a real `JmapClient`
 * over a fetch mock: `packages/jmap/src/test-support.ts` is deliberately outside the package's
 * published surface, so app-side tests fake the seam (see `settings/identity-client.test.ts`).
