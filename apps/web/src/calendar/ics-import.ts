/**
 * Reading a `.ics` file into events (K-4, FR-CAL-01) — via the SERVER's parser.
 *
 * **No iCalendar parser ships in this bundle.** `CalendarEvent/parse` hands a blob to Stalwart and
 * gets JSCalendar back, which is the same conversion the server does for every CalDAV client it
 * serves — a second implementation here would be a second set of bugs about `VTIMEZONE`, folded
 * lines and `RRULE` in a bundle that has 18 kB of headroom.
 *
 * **The value per blob is an ARRAY, and losing that is silent.** One VCALENDAR may hold many
 * VEVENTs; a client that reads `parsed[blobId]` as an object keeps the first and drops the rest
 * with no error anywhere. Measured on v0.16.18 with a two-VEVENT file: two entries, in document
 * order.
 *
 * **What has to come off before a create, and why each one.**
 *  - `method` — **immutable**, measured on create as well as update
 *    (`"This property is immutable."`). A parsed invitation carries `method: "request"`, so leaving
 *    it in fails the whole create. It would also be wrong if it worked: an imported file is not an
 *    invitation this account received.
 *  - `iCalendar` — the sidecar describing how the VEVENT was converted (`convertedProperties`).
 *    Accepted on create, measured, but it is the server's record of a conversion that is now over.
 *  - `id`, `created`, `updated`, `isOrigin`, `baseEventId` — server-owned, the same list
 *    `restoreEvent` strips.
 *
 * **What stays: `uid`.** It is what makes a second import of the same file a refusal rather than a
 * duplicate — and the refusal is per object and loud:
 * `{"type":"invalidProperties","description":"An event with UID probe-1@waxwing.test already
 * exists.","properties":["uid"]}`. So the importer can say "3 added, 2 already there" precisely,
 * instead of either duplicating or guessing.
 *
 * **Export is not here, and that is measured, not deferred.** `CalendarEvent/get` with
 * `properties: ["iCalendar"|"blobId"|"iCalendarBlobId"|"ical"]` answers `{"id":"e"}` every time —
 * silently dropped; `CalendarEvent/export` is `unknownMethod`; there is no blob and no download URL
 * for an event. The only way out over JMAP would be a serialiser written here, which would be
 * lossy in exactly the properties this client does not model. It is left out rather than shipped
 * with a caveat.
