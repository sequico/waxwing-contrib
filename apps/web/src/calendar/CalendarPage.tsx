/**
 * The calendar screen (M5.6, FR-CAL-01) — a lazy route chunk.
 *
 * Three views: a **month** grid for orientation, a **week** grid with a time axis, and an **agenda**
 * list for "what is next".
 *
 * Events can be created, edited and deleted (M5.11) — **including repeating ones (K-2)**. A series
 * no longer opens a read-only note: it opens the editor, and the scope question ("this event" /
 * "all events") is asked after Save, which is where Apple asks it and the only place it can be
 * answered. `refuseEdit` still draws one line: an occurrence the client cannot trace back to a
 * writable object is refused, with its own sentence, because the alternative is the editor T1
 * described, whose Save could never work.
 *
 * **Participants and RSVP (K-3)** ride in the same editor. The answer bar appears only when one of
 * the participants carries an address this account owns — which is what `ParticipantIdentity/get`
 * (K-10) is fetched for, once per mount — and the calendar grants `mayRSVP`. Inviting works because
 * `CalendarEvent/set` is given `sendSchedulingMessages: true`; measured, it is the only trigger.
 *
 * **One interaction rule across all three views:** clicking a DAY selects it, clicking an EVENT
 * opens it, and the `+` in the bar creates on the day that is selected. A day cell used to open the
 * new-event dialog directly, which meant the grid had no way to say "I mean this day" — the URL
 * never moved, so the arrow keys, `Today` and `+` all still pointed somewhere else (T6).
 *
 * **The calendars themselves are managed here too (K-1), and that changes what the grid asks for.**
 * The list of calendars is a rail from 40em up and a screen-high sheet below it, reached from the
 * same view menu that already carries Today. Ticking one off writes `isVisible` to the SERVER and
 * then re-fetches the month naming only the calendars that are on — `eventsInRange`'s third
 * parameter, which had existed since M5.6 with no caller. So the two loads are no longer
 * independent: the calendars are fetched first and the events depend on their answer, which costs
 * one extra round trip on the first paint and none afterwards. The alternative, filtering the drawn
 * list locally, looks the same on this screen and is a lie on the phone.
