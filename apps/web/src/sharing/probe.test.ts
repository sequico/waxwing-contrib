/**
 * The probe that stops a shared CALENDAR from growing a mail section — and a shared MAILBOX from
 * growing a contacts one (S-4).
 *
 * The scenario every test here is built on was measured against the live Stalwart v0.16.18 fixture
 * on 2026-08-21, and it is the single most surprising fact in the whole sharing package:
 *
 *   carol shared ONE CALENDAR with alice, and nothing else.
 *   alice's session then listed carol's account `d` with **all seventeen** capabilities,
 *   `urn:ietf:params:jmap:mail` among them.
 *   `Mailbox/get { accountId: "d" }` → `error forbidden "You do not have access to account d"`.
 *
 * Re-measured the other way round on the same day, to check the rule generalises: alice shared ONE
 * ADDRESS BOOK with carol, and in a single batch `AddressBook/get` answered a list while
 * `Mailbox/get`, `FileNode/get` and `FileNode/query` all answered `forbidden`.
 *
 * `secondaryMailAccounts()` reads exactly that capability, and is documented at length as the
 * strictest test the session offers. It is still a false positive here — so the assertion "a
 * fully-capable account that refuses `AddressBook/get` gets no contacts section" cannot be checked
 * anywhere but against this probe.
