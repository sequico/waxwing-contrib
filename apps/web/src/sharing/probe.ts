/**
 * Which shared accounts really have mail, contacts or files in them (the S-4 measurement).
 *
 * ## The session lies, and it lies in the direction that shows a section for nothing
 *
 * `secondaryMailAccounts()` decides "this account has mail" from the account's OWN
 * `accountCapabilities` — the strictest test the session offers, and documented at length as such.
 * It is still not enough. **Measured against Stalwart v0.16.18 on 2026-08-21:** carol shared ONE
 * CALENDAR with alice and nothing else, and alice's session then listed carol's account with all
 * **seventeen** capabilities, `urn:ietf:params:jmap:mail` among them. The share made the whole
 * account visible; it did not make the mail in it readable.
 *
 * What the sidebar did with that is the defect: a labelled "carol@waxwing.test" section, a folder
 * tree that can never fill, and a sync engine started for an account every request to which comes
 * back `forbidden`.
 *
 * ## The fix is one extra round trip for the whole rail, and the server made it cheap
 *
 * Asking is unambiguous where the capability is not:
 * ```
 * Mailbox/get { accountId: "d", ids: [] } → error forbidden "You do not have access to account d"
 * ```
 * That is better than an empty list, which would also be the answer for "shared, but empty".
 *
 * And **`forbidden` is a LOCAL error**: measured, a batch of five calls of which three were refused
 * returned all five method responses. (Unlike `Principal/set` or an unknown `using` URN, either of
 * which takes the entire request down with HTTP 400 `notRequest` — see `packages/jmap`'s
 * `sharing.test.ts`.) So one call per account, all in ONE batch, settles the whole rail.
 *
 * `ids: []` rather than `ids: null`: the access check happens before the fetch — measured, an empty
 * id list is refused exactly the same way — so the probe costs the server nothing but the lookup.
 *
 * ## The same question, for the other two areas (S-4, measured 2026-08-21)
 *
 * Mail is not special. Re-measured against the same fixture, in both directions, with exactly one
 * object shared:
 * ```
 * # alice shares nothing with carol; carol asks about account b
 * AddressBook/get {ids:[]}  → forbidden        FileNode/get {ids:[]}  → forbidden
 * Mailbox/get    {ids:[]}   → forbidden        FileNode/query          → forbidden
 *
 * # alice shares ONE ADDRESS BOOK with carol; carol asks again, same batch
 * AddressBook/get {ids:[]}  → { list: [] }     FileNode/get {ids:[]}  → forbidden
 * Mailbox/get    {ids:[]}   → forbidden        FileNode/query          → forbidden
 * ```
 * So the probe generalises without qualification: one `Foo/get` with an EMPTY id list per area,
 * per account, all in one batch. `FileNode/get` and `FileNode/query` were measured to agree in
 * every observed state, and `/get` is chosen so all three areas send the same shape.
 *
 * **One known lag, and it is the server's:** revoking the last share of an area leaves that area
 * answering for a while (measured — destroying the only shared `FileNode` left `FileNode/query`
 * answering an empty list rather than `forbidden`). The failure mode is an empty section, never a
 * wrong one, and it settles by itself.
